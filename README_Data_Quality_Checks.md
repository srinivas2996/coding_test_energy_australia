Sure, here's an example of how the `readme.md` file could be created to provide some context and instructions for running the tests:

```markdown
# Great Expectations Test Suite

This repository contains pytest test functions to validate data quality using Great Expectations for the CSV file `cust-test.csv`.

## Requirements

To run the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (tested with Python 3.7 and above)
- great_expectations library (`pip install great_expectations`)
- pytest (`pip install pytest`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-great-expectations-test.git
cd your-great-expectations-test
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Tests

The test functions use Great Expectations to validate the data in the CSV file. To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest test_expectations.py
```

The tests will be executed, and you will see the test results on the console.

## Understanding the Tests

The test functions in `test_expectations.py` correspond to specific data quality checks for the `cust-test.csv` file:

1. `test_expect_column_values_not_to_be_null`: Checks that the 'customerid' column does not contain null values.
2. `test_expect_column_values_to_be_between`: Checks that the 'age' column contains values within the range of 10 to 100 (inclusive).
3. `test_expect_column_values_to_be_in_set`: Checks that the 'gender' column contains values that are either "M", "F", or "Other".

If any of the tests fail, the output will indicate the reason for the failure, helping you identify potential data quality issues.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or would like to contribute to this test suite, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!

Happy testing! ðŸš€
