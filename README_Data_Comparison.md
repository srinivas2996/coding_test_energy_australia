Sure! Below is a sample README file for the data comparison script you provided:

# Data Comparison Script

This script performs a data comparison between a SQL table and a CSV file. It connects to the SQL database, fetches data from the specified table, and reads data from the CSV file. Then, it converts the data into pandas dataframes and compares them column by column.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library
- psycopg2 library (for PostgreSQL database connection)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas psycopg2
```

3. Set up your database connection details in the `db_connection.py` file.

## Usage

1. Make sure the SQL table and CSV file have the same columns and data types for comparison.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```
python test_data_comparison.py
```

The script will connect to the database, fetch data from the SQL table, and read data from the CSV file. It will then compare the two datasets column by column and print any data mismatches. If there are no data mismatches, the test will pass, and a success message will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the database connection, verify that the connection details in `db_connection.py` are correct.
- Ensure that the CSV file path in the `read_data_from_csv` function is pointing to the correct location.
